          <h3>Summer School at ISI</h3>
          <p>Jun 3 - Jun 21 , 2019</p>
          <p>I spent 3 weeks at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore to better my math and analysis skill. We covered Real Analysis, Group Theory, Linear Algebra in depth and had a basic introduction to the topics of Probability, Linear Algebraic methods in Combinatorics and Minimal Surfaces. The topics were covered in depth, and emphasis was put on getting to the proof of things.</p>

          <h3>Volunteer at AIESEC</h3>
          <p>Jun 16 - Aug 1, 2018</p>
          <p>AIESEC offers programs promoted by the United Nations, where they try to have cross border interaction amongst the youth with the objective of reducing xenophobic tendencies and inequalities. As a part of this program I went to a summer school for kids in Thessaloniki, Greece for 45 days and interacted with them and talked about India. In the process I also learned how to manage and work with people.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="proj-row">
          <h3>Sudoku Solver | Semester 5</h3>
          <p>As part of my Artificial Intelligence course, we had to make a sudoku solver that satisfies the constraints a sudoku. The User can input the start state of the puzzle on the GUI or through a CSV file. I did the project on Java. </p>
          <p>I've explained the method I devised<a href="https://github.com/AnushaPorwal/SudokuSolver/blob/master/ReadMe.pdf">here, </a>
          and the entire thing is available<a href="https://github.com/AnushaPorwal/SudokuSolver">here.</a></p>

        <div class="proj-row">
          <h3>Material Management System | Semester 4</h3>
          <p>We built a material management system for a solvent manufacturing company. It keeps track of the quantities of raw materials and end products, where they were bought from and who they were sold to. It also keeps track of the tanks that store these materials and the properties of the materials. We also made different access levels so that different employees can add and modify only specific tables. We made the front-end using Java and did the back-end database management using MySQL.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="proj-row">
          <h3>Text Editor | Semester 3</h3>
          <p>As a part of our Java course we made a Text Editor that could create, edit, and view files. You could type out your content, change the font, size and emphasis. Other functionalities of the editor were, cut, copy and paste, find, replace and replace all. We called our text editor Feather n’ Ink Text Editor.</p>

          <h3>SIM: A Game based on Ramsey’S Theorem | Semester 3</h3>
          <p>As part of my course in Discrete Mathematics, I did a research – based project on SIM, which is a two-player game based on Ramsey’s Theorem of Friends and Strangers in graph theory. The theorem helps prove that the game will always have a winner, if the setup has 6 dots to begin with.</p>

        <h2>Other Interesting things I've done</h2>
        <div class="interest-row">
          <h3>Worked on a Fuzzy String Search Project</h3>
          <p>I used an implementation of the Levenshtein distance to fuzzily match names against a list of names. Whenever I did not have a 100% match, I looked at the top 3 matches to figure out the best match. Sometimes, the second – best match was the correct match. I used the fuzzywuzzy package on Python to do the match. The project required some data cleaning and formatting, so that the search was made easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interest-row">
          <h3>Web Scraping</h3>
          <p>For a project I’m currently working on, I needed to scrape lyrics off the Internet. I used lyrics.com for the scraping. I did this in two parts: the first was getting all the links of the artist names, each link will have all the songs by that artist. The next part is using those links to get all the lyrics. I used BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages on Python for this task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interest-row">
          <h3>Coded and Plot some Famous Fractals</h3>
          <p>During the summer break I came across mathematical art: Fractals. They are geometrical figures, with fractional dimensions and whose parts have the same characteristics as the whole figure. I plotted the Sierpinski Triangle, the Koch Snowflake and the Mandelbrot Set in quadradic and cubic.</p>
